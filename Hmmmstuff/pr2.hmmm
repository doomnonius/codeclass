# This is a placeholder whose code you'll replace:
00 read r1          # get # from user to r1
01 read r2          # ditto, for r2
02 copy r3 r1       # set r3 to r1
03 addn r2 -1       # reduce r2 by 1 before you start multiplying
04 jeqzn r2 07      # if r2 is zero, write r3 and halt
05 mul r3 r3 r1     # multiply
06 jumpn 03         # jump back to reducing r2
07 write r3         # write result r3
08 halt
